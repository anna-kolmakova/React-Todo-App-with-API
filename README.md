# React Todo App with API (complete). Done with REST API.

Technologies used: React hooks, lifting state up, functional components.

> Here is [the working example]( https://anna-kolmakova.github.io/React-Todo-App-with-API//)
1.Enter your email to create a user or find an existing one in the API.

1) Addind a todo with the entered title on form submit:

if the title is empty it will show the 'Title can't be empty' notification at the bottom;
input disabled receiving the response from the API;
showed the loader on the added todo;
in case of API error - it will show 'Unable to add a todo' notification at the bottom;

2) Filtering todos with bottons on footer: All, Completed, Active.
3) Deleting separate todos or completed (showed the loader on the removed todo);
4) Changing todo name with double click on todo.
5) Changing statis (active to completed) for all todos
